# HydroCrisis-Forecasting-Droughts-through-Weather-and-Soil-Data-Analysis-Using-Time-Series-Models

**About the Dataset:**

* This dataset exists thanks to the generous contributions of the NASA POWER Project and the
dedicated authors behind the US Drought Monitor. These groups have provided valuable data that
allow us to study and predict droughts.

* The data comes from the NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) POWER Project, funded by
NASA's Earth Science/Applied Science Program. This project gathers important weather and soil
information, enabling us to analyze droughts effectively.

* The US Drought Monitor, a collaboration between the National Drought Mitigation Center, the US
Department of Agriculture, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, has also
played a key role. Their data helps us understand current drought conditions, making our
predictions more accurate.

* We've also used the Harmonized World Soil Database, a global soil resource created by experts.
This database helps us study soil properties and their connection to droughts.

By combining these resources, we're able to explore droughts and develop methods to predict and
manage them better. It's a collaborative effort that enhances our understanding of this important
environmental challenge.


**Objectives:**

* **Drought Prediction:** Develop a model that can predict the likelihood of drought events based on
weather and soil data.

* **Early Warning System:** Create an early warning system that alerts relevant stakeholders about
potential drought conditions in advance.

* **Data Analysis:** Gain insights into the relationships between weather, soil, and drought occurrences
through exploratory data analysis.
